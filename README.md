Set up the .env files: We'll have two databases in this project: one for real-looking dev data, and another for simpler test data.

You will need to create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.

You'll need to run npm install at this point.
